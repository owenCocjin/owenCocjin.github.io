# Website
> My personal website, detailing CTF writeups, custom scripts, and tools encountered during engagements.

## To-Do:
- Enable cookie to prevent home page from running through entire 6s animation (it gets tedious I'll admit)
- Indicate the reference link when clicking on reference buttons (ex. make a resource link glow when clicking on the reference)
- ~~Change codeblock to be a scroll-enabled box (instead of just a bunch of code lines)~~
- ~~Make mobile-friendly~~
- Fix overflowing images
	- So far, only landscape mobiles affected
	- Current fix is overflow scrolls, but I'd prefer a better solution
- Fix menu on mobile
	- Some buttons overflow
- ~~Restructure site (directories of blogs n such)~~
- Prevent the logbox from resizing when changing log data font
