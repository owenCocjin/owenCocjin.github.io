> My personal website, detailing CTF writeups, custom scripts, and tools encountered during engagements.

## To-Do:
- Enable cookie to prevent home page from running through entire 6s animation (it gets tedious I'll admit)

- Change codeblock to be a scroll-enabled box (instead of just a bunch of code lines)
